<h2>Motivation for the Project</h2>

Similar to before I made another ohmmeter to measure the resistance of a resistor, but this time with a potentiometer, which served as tuner for the voltage. I tuned the voltage to provide me with the most accurate reading of the resistor’s resistance in Ohms since I since still relied on finding the resistance with Ohm’s law R = V / I. However, the Arduino code was modified to account for the potentiometer. Additionally, to verify the resistance was accurate I both identified the resistance of the resistor by observing its color bands and also using a digital multi-meter to ensure my ohmmeter on the breadboard is accurate. Hence, building this ohmmeter largely assisted me in getting comfortable with Arduino programming.
